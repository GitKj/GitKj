I am a senior Computer Science student at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida (est. December 2021). I am an Incoming Software Engineer at Amazon in Seattle, Washington (February 2021). I am a previous Amazon Propel Intern (SDE, Summmer 2021) and also interned at GeekSI in Tallahassee, Florida as a Software Development intern.
