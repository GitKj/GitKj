### Hi there, I'm Kajoyrie! ðŸ‘‹

A little about me
-------------------
I am a senior computer science student at Florida State University in Tallhassee, Florida (est. December 2021). I am a current Software Developer Intern at GeekSI in Tallahassee, Florida and also have the amazing opportunity to be a Software Development Engineering Intern at Amazon in Seattle, Washington this upcoming summer (2021). In my freetime I like to play basketball, or watch it (Prayers up for GSW please!). I also thoroughly enjoy watching any show that Gordon Ramsey is in (Kitchen Nightmare's, MasterChef etc), and lastly I like to skateboard!
