### Hi there, I'm Kajoyrie! 👋

I am a full time software engineer at Amazon. I am a previous Amazon Propel Intern (SDE, Summmer 2021) and also interned at GeekSI in Tallahassee, Florida as a Software Development intern. In my freetime I like to play basketball, or watch it (Lets go GSW!). I also thoroughly enjoy watching any show that Gordon Ramsey is in (Kitchen Nightmare's, MasterChef etc), and lastly I like to skateboard!

Here are some of my best projects:
- Personal website created with HTML/CSS ---- https://gitkj.github.io/
- One of my favorite game shows, Jeopardy, created with Python ---- https://github.com/GitKj/Jeopardy
